HOW TO RUN the test:

Open run.py and change the data path in "load_data", 
so that it loads the desired file. Then, run run.py


In this folder we submit: 
.run.py
	.File to run for the test (prediction)
	loads the variables - degrees, weights, top_features and other features. These are necessary
	to make the predictions from the test data. Then it makes the predictions for the labels
	using the test data

.Code notebook
	.Contains all the code including: data analysis and preprocessing/cleaning, the training
	 with the chosen method (ridge regression) and the code that is common to run.py for the predictions

.implementations.py
	.where we have the basic functions as well as other functions necessary for the project	


.Report.

.helpers and proj1 helpers
	.which contain auxiliar functions used in the project

. .pickle files 
	.that save the results we need to run run.py
