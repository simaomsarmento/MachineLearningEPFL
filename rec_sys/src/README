   You also need Jupyter if you want to train the model in ``RecSys-Project2-CV.ipynb.ipynb''

Folder Content
   In this folder we submit:
   - run.py: runs the prediction using the already trained model
   - recsys.ipynb: trains the model and runs it
   - report.pdf: the report
   - functions.py and helpers.py: files with auxiliary functions used in the project
   - model.pickle: parameters of the trained model
   - Data: folder with training data and sample submission
